# Power-System-Fault-Detection-and-Classification

This project involves building a machine learning model to detect and classify different types of faults in a power distribution system automatically. It uses real-time electrical parameters such as voltage, current, and phasors to distinguish between normal and faulty conditions.

## Problem Statement:
Design a machine learning model to detect and classify different types of faults in a power 
distribution system. Using electrical measurement data (e.g., voltage and current 
phasors), the model should be able to distinguish between normal operating conditions 
and various fault conditions (such as line-to-ground, line-to-line, or three-phase faults). 
The objective is to enable rapid and accurate fault identification, which is crucial for 
maintaining power grid stability and reliability.
